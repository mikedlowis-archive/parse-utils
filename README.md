About This Project
----------------------------------------------
This project implements a library of useful classes for developing recursive
descent parsers in c/c++. The library provides a generic abstract syntax tree
class, lexer and parser base classes, as well as a tree visistor class with a
useful implementation for pretty printing an arbitrary syntax tree. Users of
this library can link against it statically or dynamically.
